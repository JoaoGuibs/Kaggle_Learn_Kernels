#### Goal:
The goal of this kernel was to train a CNN model that would be able to identify ships in satellite images (binary classification problem). 
The provided data-set contains several images of ships and "not-ships".
Finally, using the model, we predicted an approximate location for the ships in each large scene.

#### Installation instructions:
First we need to install pip and then pipenv:

* ```sudo apt-get install python3-pip ```
* ```pip3 install pipenv ```

Finally open a terminal inside the moon_data folder and:

* ```pipenv install ```
	
If everything goes well we already installed all the necessary dependencies, including jupyter notebook.
We can open the jupyter notebook by:

* ```jupyter notebook ```

#### Addittional Information:
If the models need to be trained, then a GPU might be necessary, therefore additional packages might be needed to be installed, as well as the correct drivers.



#### Results:
