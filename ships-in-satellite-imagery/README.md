# Ships in Satellite Imagery

## Goal:
The goal of this kernel was to train a CNN model that would be able to identify ships in satellite images (binary classification problem). 
The provided data-set contains several images of ships and "not-ships".
Finally, using the model, we predicted an approximate location for the ships in each large scene.

## Procedure:

We trained the network using several convolution layers and a set of fully connected layers.

## Results:

### Input image:

<img src="Data/lb_4.png" width="500" height=auto>

### Output image:
