#### Installation instructions:
First we need to install pip and then pipenv:

* ```sh sudo apt-get install python3-pip ```
* ```sh pip3 install pipenv ```

Finally open a terminal inside the moon_data folder and:

* ```pipenv install ```
	
If everything goes well we already installed all the necessary dependencies, including jupyter notebook.
We can open the jupyter notebook by:

* ```sh jupyter notebook ```

#### Addittional Information:
If the models need to be trained, then a GPU might be necessary, therefore additional packages might be needed to be installed, as well as the correct drivers.
